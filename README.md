Hi everyone! 

My name is Alan Martinez, I'm a React Js Developer.

This Web App has been created with the porpuse of giving you all the necesary weather data about your current city.

And allow you to search the weather of the cities of your interest.

I hope you find this web application useful.

In this web application I made use of the weather API, OpenWeatherMap.
